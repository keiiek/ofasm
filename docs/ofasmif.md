# Chapter 2. OFASM interface

This chapter describes about the OFASM interface which enables to to call a program in OFASM binary from a native binary.

## Section 1. Background

Unlike the linux native binary, OFASM binary has it's own binary format and runs on top of the OFASM VM.  
Due to this difference, it is impossible to directly call a function in OFASM binary from native binary and vice versa.
